# **AI-Powered Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) for Smart Cities**

## Overview

The **AI-Powered ADAS** project integrates **Satellite Imagery**, **Deep Learning**, and **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication** to enhance road safety, pedestrian protection, and traffic management. With an emphasis on **real-time lane detection**, **collision alerts**, **road sign recognition**, and **pedestrian safety**, the project aims to revolutionize how vehicles interact with their environment. The system works by leveraging satellite images to predict potential hazards, enhance navigation accuracy, and ensure a safer driving experience, especially in the context of urban environments.

## Key Features

1. **Satellite Image Recognition with Deep Learning**
   - Our deep learning model processes high-resolution satellite images to detect changes in urban landscapes, road conditions, and traffic patterns. This data is then used for urban planning, disaster management, and road safety improvements.
  
2. **Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication**
   - V2V enables real-time communication between vehicles to share crucial data like speed, position, and potential hazards. This communication helps avoid collisions and enhances traffic flow.

3. **Lane Detection and Correction**
   - Real-time lane detection and correction, including addressing known errors in lane-keeping systems (e.g., Tesla), by continuously adjusting the vehicle’s path to ensure it stays within the lane boundaries.

4. **Collision Detection and Alert System**
   - The AI system detects objects and pedestrians in the vehicle’s path, providing real-time collision alerts to prevent accidents. The system uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for accurate object detection.

5. **Pedestrian Safety Enhancement**
   - Leveraging AI, our system enhances pedestrian safety by analyzing potential pedestrian paths and providing early warnings to drivers in real-time.

6. **Road Sign Recognition**
   - The system automatically identifies and interprets road signs using deep learning, ensuring that drivers receive timely alerts about speed limits, stop signs, and other important instructions.

7. **Smart Traffic Management**
   - By analyzing satellite imagery and real-time data, the system predicts traffic congestion, identifies accident hotspots, and suggests optimal routes for drivers.

## Usage

### How to Use the System

- **Real-Time Lane Detection & Collision Alerts:**
   1. Ensure that your vehicle is equipped with a camera or a suitable device to capture real-time footage.
   2. The system processes this data to detect lane boundaries, and objects (cars, pedestrians), and alert the driver if a collision is imminent.
  
- **Satellite Imagery for Traffic Analysis:**
   - Input the geographical area or city coordinates into the provided UI to retrieve satellite imagery.
   - The system analyzes urban growth, traffic density, and road conditions.
   - You can visualize the data with graphical insights to assist in urban planning and traffic management.

- **Pedestrian Safety Alerts:**
   - The system identifies potential pedestrian paths and provides early warnings through sound or visual alerts, ensuring safer interactions between vehicles and pedestrians.

## Key Features

1. **Real-Time Data Processing:**
   - Satellite imagery and real-time camera feeds are processed using deep learning models to extract valuable insights, such as vehicle detection, road conditions, and hazard identification.

2. **Advanced Object Detection with YOLO:**
   - Uses YOLO for detecting pedestrians, other vehicles, and obstacles on the road. This improves the collision alert system by providing accurate and rapid object detection.

3. **V2V Communication for Traffic Safety:**
   - The system enables real-time communication between vehicles, sharing data about their current state (e.g., speed, location), helping prevent accidents by notifying vehicles of hazards ahead.

4. **Lane Detection and Correction:**
   - The system detects and corrects lane drift in real-time, helping vehicles stay within their lanes even in challenging weather conditions or poor visibility.
